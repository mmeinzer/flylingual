## How to start practicing for the private pilot knowledge test

The computerized knowledge test is a significant step in obtaining your pilot’s license, and it’s never too early to start practicing. These private pilot practice tests cost nothing to use and offer some great direction on what topics you should be studying more.

The resources I’ve highlighted below are an excellent way to get started for free. Because the tests are free, you should start taking them early and often. Just don’t fall into the trap of memorizing answers. Make sure you understand the “why” behind each question, and I guarantee you’ll do well on test day.

Since the FAA no longer publishes the entire bank of test questions (yes, they used to do that), you should expect some differences between any practice test and the real exam. I find it best to use these tests as in indication of preparedness.

## King Schools Test Questions

John and Martha at King Schools have been in the aviation education business since 1973. You’d be hard-pressed to find a pilot in the US that hasn’t at least heard of them. Their website offers a bank of free test prep questions and the ability to choose how many questions you’d like to attempt as well as which categories you want to focus on.

## Sporty’s Study Buddy Practice Test

Sporty’s is another well-known resource in the aviation community. Their Study Buddy tool offers a 60 question timed practice test or the option to select specific topics, similar to the King Schools study site.

## Exams 4 Pilots

While the website design and domain name seem like a throwback to the older days of the web, the practice questions on Exams 4 Pilots seem just as good as any of the other review sites. Be sure to select the proper exam type—“Private Pilot Airplane” in my case, and to check the box that says: “Skip questions with missing figures.”

## FAA PAR Sample Exam

This PDF is ideal for printing to take on the go. Although the FAA doesn’t publish the answers, this is another great tool for determining any knowledge gaps you might have. Each question has a PLT number which corresponds to an FAA learning statement. If I were having trouble with question 1 on the practice exam, I would reference “PLT025” on the learning statement guide and see that I should probably do some reading on Bernoulli’s principle.
